<h1>Which browser should you design for?</h1>
<article>
<strong>The answer is all of them.</strong> If you survey a group of computer 
aficionados you will get very different answers compared with the general 
public’s answers.&nbsp; 
I worked as a freelance computer technician for over eleven years, During that 
period 
I never came across a single person who was using a browser other than Internet Explorer. 
<aside>
The great majority of ordinary folk are using IE because it came pre-installed with their computers.

None had ever heard of Mozilla Firefox, although I did meet one person whose son had put Firefox on his computer, 
he wanted me to remove it because he did not know what it was. 
The great majority of ordinary folk are using IE because it came pre-installed 
with their computers. When reading magazine surveys, it would be safer to increase the survey figures for Internet Explorer. 
The result would mean that you should make sure that your websites work in IE7 and IE8 because these 
are the most popular by default. It would be safe to predict that there will be a strong swing 
towards IE 9 when it is finalised in 2011.
