          <p><b>If you are on dial-up: </b>Use the cover DVD from a PC magazine 
		  and copy the AV file from the disk into your Downloads folder.</p>
          <p><b>Either broadband or dial up:</b> With the installation file 
		  safely saved in the Downloads folder <b>disconnect from the internet</b> 
		  (because after the next step you will be temporarily unprotected).</p>
          <h3>Warning: Do not run two anti-virus programs on a computer, they 
		  will conflict.</h3>
		    Uninstall your current anti-virus program. Go to <b>Start</b>--&gt;<b>Control 
			panel--&gt;Add/remove programs.
          </b>
          <p><b>If you already have an older version of XXX</b> on your computer 
		  there is <b>no need to uninstall it</b>, the new XXX will do this 
		  automatically. </p>
          <h3>The downloaded XXX file in your Downloads folder</h3>
		    is in the form of a compressed file which has to be unpacked. Unpack 
			(install) it by double clicking it. (the file is called something 
			similar to XXX-free-fts-en-85-100a1328, the last set of figures will 
			be different in your case).
          <p><b>During the installation</b>, if you had a previous version of 
		  XXX, tick the box to keep your personal settings. Also I always choose
          <b>not</b> to have automatic scanning at start-up.</p>
          <h3>When asked if you would like the XXX security bar</h3> I always 
			say no and I un-tick the box. I find all these add-on gadgets are 
			<br>
		 		 (i) a clutter, <br>
		 		 (ii) unnecessary, and <br>
		 (iii) they often create 
			problems.
          <p><b>Continue installing.</b> I usually click <b>Skip</b> on the 
		  &#39;update panel&#39; and then update later when I am sure the program is 
		  safely installed and configured. Re-start the computer.</p><br>

            <h3>Configuring a free anti-virus program</h3>
              This means setting it to work according to your preferences. The 
			  following settings are my own preference, but you can alter them 
			  to suit yourself.<br>
			  <div class="cntr"><img title="Advanced settings for XXX" alt="Advanced settings for XXX" height="229" src="images/xxxadvanced.jpg" width="227">
			  </div>
			  <div class="lft"><h3>Configuring the email scanner: </h3>
            	  On XXX&#39;s top menu click click <b>Tools--&gt;Advanced</b> <b>
            	  Settings</b>. On the left hand panel, click the icon labelled <b>
            	  Email scanner. </b>On the next screen, temporarily place a 
				  tick in the box labelled <b>Check outgoing e-mail</b>. Un-tick 
				  the box below it labelled <b>Certify e-mail</b>. Now cancel 
				  the temporary tick in the box labelled <b>Check outgoing 
				  e-mail. <br>
            </b>Under the heading Check incoming e-mail un-tick the box labelled 
				  Certify mail. Ensure that the top box is ticked&nbsp; so that <b>
            	  incoming</b> emails are scanned.<br><br>
            <h3>I do not like automatic scanning every time I switch on.</h3> 
            	  This daily activity is unnecessary and slows down the start-up 
				  process. I only scan my computer for viruses (manually) <b>
				  once a month or when odd things are happening</b>. If you did 
				  not cancel the automatic scanning during your installation, 
				  you can stop this activity by double clicking the <b>XXX icon</b> 
				  on the <b>Desktop</b>. Then on the top menu click <b>
				  Tools--&gt;Advanced</b> <b>Settings</b>. On the left hand panel, 
				  click the plus sign in the box labelled <b>
            	  Schedules</b>, then click <b>Scheduled scan</b>. Click the box 
				  labelled <b>Enable this task </b>to remove the tick and then 
				  click <b>
            	  Apply</b>. On the left hand panel click <b>Program Update 
				  Schedule.
            </b>Click to remove the tick in the box labelled <b>Enable this 
				  task.</b>Click <b>Apply</b>.<br><br>
            <h3>Automatic updating: </h3>Most people do not like being 
				  interrupted by XXX&#39;s automatic update, especially if they are 
				  on dial-up. I like to update when it is convenient, not when 
				  XXX dictates.<br>You will always know when to update because 
				  the XXX icon in the notification area will be a black blob 
				  instead of a brightly coloured icon. XXX cannot be set to a 
				  manual&nbsp; update, but here is an easy work-around: On XXX&#39;s top 
				  menu, click <b>Tools--&gt;Advanced</b> <b>Settings</b>. On the 
				  left hand panel, click the plus sign in the box labelled&nbsp; <b>
				  Schedules</b>, then click <b>Virus database update schedule</b>. 
				  Find <b>Run at a specific time</b> and change the time to an 
				  hour when you are not around, say 03.00am. Un-tick all the 
				  square boxes except under <b>Task settings</b> where <b>Enable 
				  this task</b> must be ticked. Click <b>Apply</b> and <b>OK</b>.&nbsp;
